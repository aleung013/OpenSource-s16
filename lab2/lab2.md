1. It is important to choose a license because licenses tell the users what they can do with your code. For example, some licenses let you use the code as long as you include their copyright. Other licenses will let you use the code as long as your code doesn't remove the freedoms of open source software.

1. You should not use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because it is,by default, all rights reserved. This is the most restrictive license, so the original owner has all rights over their code.

1. I agree that Gopher did not follow the open system model. Gopher developer decided to make decisions about the protocol on their own instead of releasing it to the public. This prevented a lot of developers from making improvements to the protocol. In addition, Gopher intended to charge a licensing fee for .com domains but keep .edu domains free.

1. Android uses the Apache 2 license. The Apache 2 license will protect their trademarks and patents, but still allow the users to use, modify and distribute their software.

1. LibreOffice uses the Mozilla Public License (MPL) 2.0. This license is a compromise between the GPL and the more permissive BSD license. It will protect the trademarks of LibreOffice, but still allows for users to modify the code.

1. GPL would be most useful for the common good because it has all the rights of free software. LGPL would be more useful for developers because it is more restrictive than a GPL liscense so it would allow more people to use their code. Apache/BSD would be most useful for a company because it would protect their trademarks.
